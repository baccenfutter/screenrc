Hi folks

I just wanted to »github« my .screenrc for anyone who's interested and for the
sake of my $BUDDY yncyrydybyl who has been bothering my to register for a github
account for almost two weeks now.

=== Insights ===
Since I don't like byobu all that much, I rather stick to the oldskool escape
sequences used back in the old days. They are definatly harder to understand
than ncurses menus, but the results just look way better at the end.

I am considering opening a bunch of branches with other look&feel stuff and
even some global configuration tweaking.

I'd be more than happy to receive pushes on what other's rc's look like or in
which way they have modified this one to suit their needs.


=== Features ===
In this initial release the following information are displayed in the bottom
line within your screen session.
 * Date (yellow)
 * Time (white)
 * The $USER (dark-green)
 * The $HOSTNAME (dark-red)
 * The loadavg (green)
 * Additionally connected users within a mutliuser session (yellow)
 * A panel showing all windows
   -> selected window (red)
   -> unselcted windows (mint)
   -> In mutltiuser sessions the other user is displayed next to the window
      he is attached to (yellow)

Enjoy!
